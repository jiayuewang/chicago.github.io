##20 days road trip (West Coast)

I have just finished 20-day road trip in US with my family. We begain from Los Angeles.  Definitive must-do´s are San Francisco and Highway 1 down to Los Angeles, but apart from that I am thinking of some different alternatives.

Actually I did a similar trip with a couple of friends two years ago: San Francisco - Highway 1 - Los Angeles - San Diego - Las Vegas - Yosemite - San Francisco. We used 19 days in total then (which I think was quite adequate) and had a great time.

Although doing about the same trip again might be an alternative, I am also thinking of an alternative: starting in Seattle. Considering the distance I am thinking driving down south and taking a flight back to Seattle from San Diego or Las Vegas. This would probably be a more interesting trip for me as I have not been north of San Francisco before. We would also avoid the quite long drive from Vegas to Yosemite which we found a bit tiring/uninteresting last time. I am thinking Yosemite rather could be visited during a couple of days while staying in San Francisco, and possibly skipping San Diego.
