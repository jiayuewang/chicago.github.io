I'm a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area, where I currently work at Google. I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a master's degree in Engineering in 2019. My technical interests include Front-end development, Machine learning, and Computer graphics. My career goal is to ultimately contribute to the advancement of our scientific understanding and spread kindness in the process.。

In my spare time, I enjoy learning about all the sports, especially swimming. I also enjoy snowboarding, dancing, ice skating, traveling, and discussing good television shows and movies.

** July 2018** I finished the 29th SF Half Marathon. ** May 2019** 3000 miles Family Road Trip in California。

Here you will find links to my latest projects, blog posts, and resources (mostly my course notes).
