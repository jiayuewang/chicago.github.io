##20 days road trip (West Coast)

I have just finished 20-day road trip in US with my family. We begain from Los Angeles

Highway 1 - Los Angeles - SF - Yosemite -Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks - Visalia - Back LA. We used 20 days in total then (which I think was quite adequate) and had a great time.
 We would also avoid the quite long drive from Vegas to Yosemite.

About four miles beyond the rookery is Hearst Castle. The mansion was originally commissioned by William Randolph Hearst and boasts larger-than-life visuals throughout the grounds.

Diving, Watching whale , kayaking, paddle boarding.
The historic district of the city centre still retains the source of California's Spanish and Mexican culture. For more than half a century, the Old Fisherman's Wharf has been one of Monterrey's top tourist destinations.
