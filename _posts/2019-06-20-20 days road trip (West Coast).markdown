**20 days road trip (West Coast) in the U.S.**

I have just finished 20-day road trip in US with my family. We begain from Los Angeles
Follow the route:
Highway 1 - Los Angeles - SF - Yosemite -Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks - Visalia - Back LA. We used 20 days in total then (which I think was quite adequate) and had a great time.

We would also avoid the quite long drive from Vegas to Yosemite.
