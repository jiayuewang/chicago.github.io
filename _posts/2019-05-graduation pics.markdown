University-wide Commencement Ceremony Description
The university-wide Commencement ceremony is the official University of Illinois academic ceremony at which the Chancellor presides and the President confers degrees. Doctoral degree candidates are invited to attend but will not be hooded at the event; Doctoral, Bachelor's, Master's and Professional (JD, DVM, and MD) degree students stand as a group at their seats and are recognized by college. This is a dignified ceremony that lasts about two hours. Academic attire is required. The university-wide Commencement ceremony is scheduled for Saturday, May 11, from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. Doors open at 8:00 a.m. for guest seating.
